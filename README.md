# java-calculator

Git exercise with a simple Java calculator program

## Feature 1: Addition & Subtraction

This branch implements the following functionality:

- **Addition**: Adds two integers (e.g., 4 + 3 = 7)
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one integer from another (e.g., 3 - 2 = 1)

## How to Run

1. Open the project in IntelliJ or any IDE of your choice.
2. Run `CalculatorTest.java` to see the test results for addition and subtraction.
3. Alternatively, run `Calculator.java` main method to see sample outputs.

## Notes

- The `feature/add-subtract` branch was used for proper Git workflow and `README.md` documentation for the first feature.

## Feature 2: Multiplication & Division

This branch adds:

- **Multiplication**: Multiply two integers (e.g., 2 * 3 = 6)
- **Division**: Divide one integer by another (e.g., 6 / 3 = 2)

### How to Run

- Run `CalculatorTest.java` to check all test cases.
- Or run `Calculator.java` main method to see sample outputs.

### Notes

- The `feature/multiply-divide` branch was used for proper Git workflow and `README.md` documentation for the second feature.
